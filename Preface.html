 构建可靠的软件很难。现代系统的规模，复杂性，介入构建过程的人数，
    还有置于系统之上的需求的范围，使得构建或多或少正确的软件很难，
    更不用说百分百正确。同一时间，因为信息处理继续融入社会的各个方面，
    程序错误于漏洞的代价越来越严重.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    计算机科学家与及软件工程师对这些挑战，通过设计一系列的改进软件质量的技手法，
    包含对管理软件项目与及编程团队的建议（比如极限编程），
    库（比如模型-试图-控制器，发布-订阅）与及编程语言

<a name="lab4"></a><h2 class="section">Logic</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Logic is the field of study whose subject matter is <i>proofs</i> &mdash;
    unassailable arguments for the truth of particular propositions.
    Volumes have been written about the central role of logic in
    computer science.  Manna and Waldinger called it "the calculus of
    computer science," while Halpern et al.'s paper <i>On the Unusual
    Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science</i> catalogs scores of
    ways in which logic offers critical tools and insights.  Indeed,
    they observe that "As a matter of fact, logic has turned out to be
    significiantly more effective in computer science than it has been
    in mathematics.  This is quite remarkable, especially since much
    of the impetus for the development of logic during the past one
    hundred years came from mathematics."

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    In particular, the fundamental notion of inductive proofs is
    ubiquitous in all of computer science.  You have surely seen them
    before, in contexts from discrete math to analysis of algorithms,
    but in this course we will examine them much more deeply than you
    have probably done so far. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab5"></a><h2 class="section">Proof Assistants</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The flow of ideas between logic and computer science has not been
    in just one direction: CS has also made important contributions to
    logic.  One of these has been the development of software tools
    for helping construct proofs of logical propositions.  These tools
    fall into two broad categories:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> <i>Automated theorem provers</i> provide "push-button" operation:
         you give them a proposition and they return either <i>true</i>,
         <i>false</i>, or <i>ran out of time</i>.  Although their capabilities
         are limited to fairly specific sorts of reasoning, they have
         matured tremendously in recent years and are used now in a
         huge variety of settings.  Examples of such tools include SAT
         solvers, SMT solvers, and model checkers.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> <i>Proof assistants</i> are hybrid tools that automate the more
         routine aspects of building proofs while depending on human
         guidance for more difficult aspects.  Widely used proof
         assistants include Isabelle, Agda, Twelf, ACL2, PVS, and Coq,
         among many others.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This course is based around Coq, a proof assistant that has been
    under development since 1983 at a number of French research labs
    and universities.  Coq provides a rich environment for interactive
    development of machine-checked formal reasoning.  The kernel of
    the Coq system is a simple proof-checker which guarantees that
    only correct deduction steps are performed.  On top of this
    kernel, the Coq environment provides high-level facilities for
    proof development, including powerful tactics for constructing
    complex proofs semi-automatically, and a large library of common
    definitions and lemmas.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Coq has been a critical enabler for a huge variety of work across
    computer science and mathematics:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> As a <i>platform for modeling programming languages</i>, it has become
      a standard tool for researchers who need to describe and reason
      about complex language definitions.  It has been used, for
      example, to check the security of the JavaCard platform,
      obtaining the highest level of common criteria certification,
      and for formal specifications of the x86 and LLVM instruction
      sets.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As an <i>environment for developing formally certified software</i>,
      Coq has been used to build CompCert, a fully-verified optimizing
      compiler for C, for proving the correctness of subtle algorithms
      involving floating point numbers, and as the basis for
      Certicrypt, an environment for reasoning about the security of
      cryptographic algorithms.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>realistic environment for programming with dependent
      types</i>, it has inspired numerous innovations.  For example, the
      Ynot project at Harvard embeds "relational Hoare reasoning" (an
      extension of the <i>Hoare Logic</i> we will see later in this course)
      in Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>proof assistant for higher-order logic</i>, it has been used
      to validate a number of important results in mathematics.  For
      example, its ability to include complex computations inside
      proofs made it possible to develop the first formally verified
      proof of the 4-color theorem.  This proof had previously been
      controversial among mathematicians because part of it included
      checking a large number of configurations using a program. In
      the Coq formalization, everything is checked, including the
      correctness of the computational part.  More recently, an even
      more massive effort led to a Coq formalization of the
      Feit-Thompson Theorem &mdash; the first major step in the
      classification of finite simple groups.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   By the way, in case you're wondering about the name, here's what
   the official Coq web site says: "Some French computer scientists
   have a tradition of naming their software as animal species: Caml,
   Elan, Foc or Phox are examples of this tacit convention. In French,
   'coq' means rooster, and it sounds like the initials of the
   Calculus of Constructions (CoC) on which it is based."  The rooster
   is also the national symbol of France, and "Coq" are the first
   three letters of the name of Thierry Coquand, one of Coq's early
   developers. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab6"></a><h2 class="section">Functional Programming</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The term <i>functional programming</i> refers both to a collection of
    programming idioms that can be used in almost any programming
    language and to a family of programming languages designed to
    emphasize these idioms, including Haskell, OCaml, Standard ML,
    F#, Scala, Scheme, Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, Erlang, and Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Functional programming has been developed over many decades &mdash;
    indeed, its roots go back to Church's lambda-calculus, which was
    invented in the 1930s before the era of the computer began!  But
    since the early '90s it has enjoyed a surge of interest among
    industrial engineers and language designers, playing a key role in
    high-value systems at companies like Jane St. Capital, Microsoft,
    Facebook, and Ericsson.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The most basic tenet of functional programming is that, as much as
    possible, computation should be <i>pure</i>, in the sense that the only
    effect of execution should be to produce a result: the computation
    should be free from <i>side effects</i> such as I/O, assignments to
    mutable variables, redirecting pointers, etc.  For example,
    whereas an <i>imperative</i> sorting function might take a list of
    numbers and rearrange its pointers to put the list in order, a
    pure sorting function would take the original list and return a
    <i>new</i> list containing the same numbers in sorted order.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    One significant benefit of this style of programming is that it
    makes programs easier to understand and reason about.  If every
    operation on a data structure yields a new data structure, leaving
    the old one intact, then there is no need to worry about how that
    structure is being shared and whether a change by one part of the
    program might break an invariant that another part of the program
    relies on.  These considerations are particularly critical in
    concurrent programs, where every piece of mutable state that is
    shared between threads is a potential source of pernicious bugs.
    Indeed, a large part of the recent interest in functional
    programming in industry is due to its simple behavior in the
    presence of concurrency.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Another reason for the current excitement about functional
    programming is related to the first: functional programs are often
    much easier to parallelize than their imperative counterparts.  If
    running a computation has no effect other than producing a result,
    then it does not matter <i>where</i> it is run.  Similarly, if a data
    structure is never modified destructively, then it can be copied
    freely, across cores or across the network.  Indeed, the MapReduce
    idiom that lies at the heart of massively distributed query
    processors like Hadoop and is used by Google to index the entire
    web is a classic example of functional programming.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    For purposes of this course, functional programming has yet
    another significant attraction: it serves as a bridge between
    logic and computer science.  Indeed, Coq itself can be viewed as a
    combination of a small but extremely expressive functional
    programming language plus with a set of tools for stating and
    proving logical assertions.  Moreover, when we come to look more
    closely, we find that these two sides of Coq are actually aspects
    of the very same underlying machinery &mdash; i.e., <i>proofs are
    programs</i>.  
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab7"></a><h2 class="section">Program Verification</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The first third of the book is devoted to developing the
    conceptual framework of logic and functional programming and
    gaining enough fluency with Coq to use it for modeling and
    reasoning about nontrivial artifacts.  From this point on, we
    increasingly turn our attention to two broad topics of critical
    importance to the enterprise of building reliable software (and
    hardware): techniques for proving specific properties of
    particular <i>programs</i> and for proving general properties of whole
    programming <i>languages</i>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    For both of these, the first thing we need is a way of
    representing programs as mathematical objects, so we can talk
    about them precisely, and ways of describing their behavior in
    terms of mathematical functions or relations.  Our tools for these
    tasks are <i>abstract syntax</i> and <i>operational semantics</i>, a method
    of specifying the behavior of programs by writing abstract
    interpreters.  At the beginning, we work with operational
    semantics in the so-called "big-step" style, which leads to
    somewhat simpler and more readable definitions, in those cases
    where it is applicable.  Later on, we switch to a more detailed
    "small-step" style, which helps make some useful distinctions
    between different sorts of "nonterminating" program behaviors and
    which is applicable to a broader range of language features,
    including concurrency.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The first programming language we consider in detail is <i>Imp</i>, a
    tiny toy language capturing the core features of conventional
    imperative programming: variables, assignment, conditionals, and
    loops. We study two different ways of reasoning about the
    properties of Imp programs.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    First, we consider what it means to say that two Imp programs are
    <i>equivalent</i> in the sense that they give the same behaviors for
    all initial memories.  This notion of equivalence then becomes a
    criterion for judging the correctness of <i>metaprograms</i> &mdash;
    programs that manipulate other programs, such as compilers and
    optimizers.  We build a simple optimizer for Imp and prove that it
    is correct.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Second, we develop a methodology for proving that Imp programs
    satisfy formal specifications of their behavior.  We introduce the
    notion of <i>Hoare triples</i> &mdash; Imp programs annotated with pre- and
    post-conditions describing what should be true about the memory in
    which they are started and what they promise to make true about
    the memory in which they terminate &mdash; and the reasoning principles
    of <i>Hoare Logic</i>, a "domain-specific logic" specialized for
    convenient compositional reasoning about imperative programs, with
    concepts like "loop invariant" built in.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This part of the course is intended to give readers a taste of the
    key ideas and mathematical tools used for a wide variety of
    real-world software and hardware verification tasks.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab8"></a><h2 class="section">Type Systems</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Our final major topic, covering the last third of the course, is
    <i>type systems</i>, a powerful set of tools for establishing
    properties of <i>all</i> programs in a given language.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Type systems are the best established and most popular example of
    a highly successful class of formal verification techniques known
    as <i>lightweight formal methods</i>.  These are reasoning techniques
    of modest power &mdash; modest enough that automatic checkers can be
    built into compilers, linkers, or program analyzers and thus be
    applied even by programmers unfamiliar with the underlying
    theories.  (Other examples of lightweight formal methods include
    hardware and software model checkers, contract checkers, and
    run-time property monitoring techniques for detecting when some
    component of a system is not behaving according to specification).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This topic brings us full circle: the language whose properties we
    study in this part, called the <i>simply typed lambda-calculus</i>, is
    essentially a simplified model of the core of Coq itself!

 Each chapter includes numerous exercises.  Each is marked with a

    Also, some exercises are marked "advanced", and some are marked

    should provide good coverage of the core material.  Optional
    exercises provide a bit of extra practice with key concepts and
